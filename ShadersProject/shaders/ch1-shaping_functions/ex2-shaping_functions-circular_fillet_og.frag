    Circular & Elliptical Shaping Functions

    Double-Linear with Circular Fillet

    This pattern joins two straight lines with a circular arc whose
    radius is adjustable.
    The user specifies the fillet's radius (with parameter c) and the
    coordinate in the unit square where the lines would otherwise intersect
    (with parameters a and b).
    This pattern is adapted from...
        Robert D. Miller's "Joining Two Lines with a Circular Arc Fillet",
        which appears in Graphics Gems.
