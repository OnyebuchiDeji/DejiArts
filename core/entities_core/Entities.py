"""
    Entities are made from MetaEntities.
    Entities are things like generic 3D shapes such as
    Cube, and even 2D shapes and basic shapes and lines.

    There are the normal Entities, these act as a wrapper over
    generic shapes and similar objects that can be created from Pygame.

    Then there are Shader Entities.
